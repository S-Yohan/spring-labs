 * exception being thrown. It should be assigned to rollback the transaction for any Exception, hence the rollbackFor.
 * You can test this by attempting to POST an array of ships where some ship in the JSON has a negative tonnage, then
 * attempting to get all ships. No ships should be POSTed if any ship in the array has a negative or zero
 * tonnage - we're left to assume some form of unwanted user error in that case.
