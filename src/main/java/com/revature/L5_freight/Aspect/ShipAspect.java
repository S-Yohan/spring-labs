/**
 * Spring AOP (aspect-oriented-programming) is a Spring module that addresses the problem of repetitive code in our
 * application.
 *
 * When a similar pattern of code is used across multiple methods in the application, it is a cross-cutting concern:
 * for instance, logging all web requests to a logging file, ensuring that a User is logged in before certain actions
 * can be performed, or starting and committing database transactions are all cross-cutting concerns, because they are
 * all some pattern of code that is applied across multiple parts of the application. AOP allows us to separate
 * these cross-cutting concerns into their own method, which can then be re-applied to the relevant methods by Spring.
 *
 * Because of this, AOP helps with code reuse, DRY (don't-repeat-yourself) principle, and allows for faster development
 * when the cross-cutting-concern needs to be modified.
 *
 * For the purpose of completing any challenges within this project: do not change anything within this class!
 * It is already complete.
